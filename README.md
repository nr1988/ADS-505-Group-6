# ADS-505-Group-6
We use Python to perform EDA, preprocessing, data splitting, model building, and model evaluation metrics to predict if a cutomer will default on a loan or not.
The machine learning models built were Logistic Regression, Adaboost, Bagging, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Linear Discriminant Analysis.
Random Forest was found to be the top performing model with the highest AUROC of 0.67. 
The final section of the notebook goes over lift charts for all models and a table of evaluation metrics for each model: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and AUROC.
